<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>Hey, how's work been?</span>
<div>I'm so glad you finally landed a job, now I don't have to take on the full rent anymore... I <strong>really</strong> hope you can hold this job down.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>It wasn't so bad, how about you?</span>
<div>You're gonna be so disappointed in me. Please change the subject.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>Oh, come on! <em>(playfully)</em> What's been going on?</span>
<div>I haven't talked to you in so long about anything other than talking about finding you a job.
I miss talking to you, I wanna see how the job went!</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span><em>(averting eyes)</em>Well, there wasn't really anything that unusual or anything...</span>
<div>You're gonna be so disappointed in me. Please change the subject.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>Well, enlighten me anyway.</span>
<div>Come on.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span><em>(awkwardly)</em>Well, I mean you know how it works. First days are always awkward. I spent like 3 hours on orientation videos.</span>
<div>How do I tell you I quit anyway?</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>Well, how about the next five hours? I mean, you didn't just spend the rest of them on lunch or something, right?</span>
<div>I have a bad feeling about this.</div>

<h2> A BEAT. </h2>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span><em>(resigned)</em> Okay.</span>
<div>Here we go.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>"Okay"? What does that mean?</span>
<div>Oh no.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span><em>(resigned)</em> Okay. So. I didn't get past the drug test.</span>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>What do you mean you didn't pass the drug test? I told you you shouldn't smoke for like a week. How hard could that be?</span>
<div>Okay. Here we go again.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>What? I hung out a few days ago with the guys. It was the Saturday when Damian finally got back from the service. What was I supposed to do?</span>
<div>I mean, come on.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>Um, you could've just skipped a day and celebrate the week after when you got the job.</span>
<div>Goddammit. I knew it. Excuses. Excuses. Excuses.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>It was a Saturday! Damien's finally back! I mean, how is that a crime?</span>
<div>How am I supposed to relax when you're always nagging at me all the time? </div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span>It's not a crime to spend your time with the guys but you've been doing it for the past 3 months. You could at least wait until you actually landed a job to do something like this. You know how hard it is to find jobs nowadays that pay a decent amount.</span>
<div>Yeah, jobs that don't require a GED. YOU CAN'T EVEN FINISH YOUR GED.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>Okay, well.<em>(monotone)</em> I'm sorry, okay? I don't even get why you're so concerned about this. It's not a big deal.</span>
<div>God. I just wanna get outta here.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span><em>(exasperated) </em>It's not a-- It <em>is</em> a <strong>big deal</strong> because I've been paying the rent for the past 3 months. </span>
<div></div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>You told me it was fine! I had a little injury at work and because of it I couldn't work there anymore.</span>
<div>So now you're complaining that I've been sitting on my ass all day the past 3 months. </div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span> You could've at least filed for unemployment. I mean, that's basically free money while you were healing up.</span>
<div>And you couldn't even do that.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>I mean, yeah I didn't think about it. I was just feeling too woozy from all the drugs. You know what? I think those drugs got into my system and that's what caused the failed test.</span>
<div>I know she's gonna eat this up.</div>

<h4>Alyssa:</h4>
<span> You might be right.</span>
<div>I need to break up with him.</div>

<h4>Jace:</h4>
<span>Yeah. And you know what? It's not a big deal. I'll really go for it next time.</span>
<div>Nailed it.</div>
